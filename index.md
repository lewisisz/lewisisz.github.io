# Hello World

Spending my whole spring term of 2017 on CIT 281 enables me to develop simple web apps, it is mind-blowing for me to learn that what I used to think as sophisticated web application could be completed in several lines. I would like to appreciate my professor Michael Hennessy for making it possible for me.
